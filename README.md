# Impact of Payment Methods on Taxi Fares (Personal Statistical Project)

## Project Overview

This is a **personal statistical project** aimed at analyzing the impact of payment methods (e.g., card vs. cash) on **taxi fares** to provide actionable insights for optimizing driver earnings. The goal is to identify how payment types influence fare amounts, with the ultimate aim of enhancing **driver satisfaction** and improving the overall success of the taxi service.

For this analysis, I utilized the extensive **NYC Taxi Trips (2017)** dataset sourced from **Kaggle**. 

### Key Steps:

1. **Descriptive Analysis**: 
   - Performed statistical analysis to summarize key aspects of the data, focusing on **fare amounts** and **payment types**.

2. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Conducted the **Mann-Whitney U Test** to evaluate the relationship between **payment type** and **fare amount**, testing the hypothesis that different payment methods influence the fare amounts.

3. **Regression Analysis**:
   - Implemented **linear regression** to evaluate the relationship between **trip duration** and **fare amount**.

## Tools & Libraries Used:
- **Python**: The programming language used for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and hypothesis testing.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and manipulation.
- **SciPy**: For performing the Mann-Whitney U test.
- **Statsmodels**: For implementing linear regression.
